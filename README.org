Tools to visualize your pagerduty alert activity.

** Get your data

First, install some dependencies in a virtualenv (or using your preferred method).

#+BEGIN_SRC
virtualenv .
./bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

Then, set some environment variables with your pagerduty API, credentials, and preferred timezone.

#+BEGIN_SRC
export PAGERDUTY_SUBDOMAIN=example
export PAGERDUTY_USER=you@example.com
export PAGERDUTY_PASS=yourpassword
export TZ=America/Chicago
#+END_SRC

=scrape.py= takes a two or more arguments. The first two define the date range you're interested in (note that the pagerduty API only supports requests for ranges less than 30 days).

#+BEGIN_SRC
./bin/python ./scrape.py 2012-09-01 2012-09-10 > data.csv
#+END_SRC

Any subsequent arguments will act as a filter, limiting the output to only rows with a user email in the list.

#+BEGIN_SRC
./bin/python ./scrape.py 2012-09-01 2012-09-10 alice@example.com bob@example.com > data.csv
#+END_SRC

You can now serve the data file and other static assets locally (or deploy them to a web server):

#+BEGIN_SRC
./bin/python -mSimpleHTTPServer
open http://localhost:8000/
#+END_SRC
